# Toy data generator for object tracking.

Go through instuctions.md to figure out how to generate the data. This was written to work on some toy data to research on some object tracking algorithms.

Generates a set of squares at random positions which remain with same dimensions through the sequence. The code can also be tinkered with to generate few exception cases, such as an object vanishing and coming back into the frame in the same sequence.
